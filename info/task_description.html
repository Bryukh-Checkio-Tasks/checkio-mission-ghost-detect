    Who hath seen the Phantom Ship, Her lordly rise and lowly dip,
    Careering o'er the lonesome mainNo port shall know her keel again....
    Ah, woe is in the awful sight,The sailor finds there eternal night,
    'Neath the waters he shall ever sleep,And Ocean will the secret keep.<br><br>

    In the northern waters sailors see Ghost Ship more frequently recent times.
    Nobody see ships since they met Ghost Ship.
    But how to distinguish a normal and ghost ship in dense fog?
    We can use locator for this.
</p>
<p>
    For a normal ship reflected signals have the same durations.
    So we wait three signals and if they have the same durations, then we are quite.
    But if you see any difference - it's better to run away.
</p>
<p>
    We have the old discrete locator so test results are looking as sequence of 1 and 0,
    where each symbol is a value for seconds. 1 is a signal, 0 is pause.
    So N consecutive 1 is a N seconds signal. Pauses can have various lengths.
    But our old locator show tests results as a number in decimal form, so you need convert it in binary form before
    analysis.
    The binary form of tests have the next pattern r"1+0+1+0+1+" (regexp).
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at examples:<br>
    - The number on locator is 21. It's "10101" in the binary form and we see 3 signals with 1 second duration each.
    This is a normal ship.<br>
    - The number is 1587. The binary form - "11000110011 and we see 3 signals with 2 seconds duration but with various
    pause.
    It's ok.<br>
    - The number is 3687. The binary form - "111001100111 and we see 3 signals. Two signals with 3 seconds duration
    and one with 2 seconds. It's better to run away.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a number and your mission is recognize is it a normal ship (True) or not.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A number as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Is it a normal ship or not as a boolean.

    This is an example of the simple pattern recognition in texts and discrete signals.
