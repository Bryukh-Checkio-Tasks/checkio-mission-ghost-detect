    "Who hath seen the Phantom Ship,
    Her lordly rise and lowly dip,
    Careering o'er the lonesome main,
    No port shall know her keel again...
    Ah, woe is in the awful sight,
    The sailor finds there eternal night,
    'Neath the waters he shall ever sleep,
    And Ocean will the secret keep”<br><br>

    In the northern waters, sailors say they’ve seen Ghost Ship patrolling the waters. Nobody can see the other ships
    after they witness the Ghost Ship. This causes a problem: how do they distinguish a normal ship from the ghost ship
    in such dense fog? We can use a locator program for this.
</p>
<p>
    For a normal ship, reflected signals have the same duration. So you wait for three signals and if they have the same
    durations, then we are safe because the ship is normal. If you see any difference - we’d better to run away, because
    that’s the Ghost Ship.

</p>
<p>
    We have the old discrete locator, so test results look like a sequence of 1’s and 0’s, where each symbol is a value
    in seconds. 1 is a signal, 0 is pause. So “N” consecutive 1’s is a “N” seconds long signal. Pauses can be various
    lengths as well. The old locator shows test results as a number in decimal form, so you will need to convert it to
    binary form before analysis can begin. The binary form of our tests have the pattern r"1+0+1+0+1+" (regexp).

</p>

<p>
    Let's look at some examples:<br>
    - The number on the locator is 21. It's "10101" in binary form and we see 3 signals with 1 second duration each.
    This is a normal ship.<br>
    - The number is 1587. The binary form is "11000110011” and we see 3 signals with 2 seconds duration but with various
    pauses. It's ok.<br>
    - The number is 3687. The binary form - "111001100111” and we see 3 signals. Two signals with 3 seconds duration and
    one with 2 seconds. It's a good idea to run away.

</p>

<p>
    You are given a number and your mission is recognize if this number reveals a normal ship (True) or not (False).

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A number as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Is it a normal ship or not as a boolean.
